          <strong>Q- Can any Nationality buy property in the UK?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes. The UK is open for investment and all nationalities can buy.
          About 30% of our clients are non-UK nationals. Many of our clients
          that are not from the UK are expats currently resident or working in
          other countries in Middle East, Africa, Far East and Europe. The rules
          and rights for overseas buyers are the same. However, non UK residents
          (even UK nationals) will have to pay an extra 2% stamp duty fee when
          buying any property. This was intruduced after 1st April 2021.

          <strong>Q- Can I buy a UK property without visiting the UK?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes. Our process is designed to be used for all clients including
          those that are not able to visit. Your ID can be attested by lawyers
          remotely or attested by a lawyer in your country to the satisfaction
          of the UK Land Registry. This can be done easily and we will provide
          full details. During 2020/2021 very few clients have visited due to
          coronavirus but we have still been helping clients buy an average of
          35 to 40 properties each month.

            Q- What is the location of these investment properties?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our properties are located in the North of England. All properties are
          located in 28 areas in the North. Majority are in the North East
          located in towns north of Leeds - such as Middlesbrough, Stockton,
          Darlington, Hartlepool, Teesside, Durham County (TS, DL and DH post
          codes). We also have Type H2L, H3L, H4L and H5L houses in the North
          West, mainly in the Lancashire towns north of Manchester, and prices
          on these are £8,000 to £10,000 higher than the prices shown. (rents on
          these are also correspondingly higher). All these areas have good
          rental demand (gross yields around 8%), are now doing well
          economically, and house prices are expected to rise better here than
          the South over the medium to long term.

          <strong>Q- Are property prices rising in the UK?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes. Property prices fell in the UK from 2007 to 2012. The fall was
          greater for lower cost properties and for properties outside London.
          Prices started to rise again in 2015 but have been relatively stagnant
          since the Brexit vote. However now they have started to rise again
          despite Post-Covid, War, Inflation and Energy Crisis. Average growth
          for such low cost properties in the UK is around 7% (see the chart
          under UK Property Market). Growth for more expensive properties -
          especially in London is low. Our expectation is that low cost houses
          will continue to rise although high cost properties in London may
          stagnate or even fall a little this year as UK interest rates rise.

          <strong>
            Q- Does a UK property purchase give me any automatic visa or
            residency rights?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          No. Purchase of any property in the UK does not give you any automatic
          residency or work rights or any permanent visa in the UK. As an
          investor, it will be easy for you to get visit visas but you do not
          get automatic residency or the ability to work in the UK. If this is
          your main aim - then you should not buy a property but seek legal
          immigration advice first.

        <p>
          <strong>Q- I have seen cheaper prices. Can I buy cheaper?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, you can, but it will cost you more! The market price does vary
          with what is included in the property, its underlying condition, if
          recently well renovated, and street location at a very local level.
          Historical prices are of course lower. Even the current prices on
          online property portals in any particular postal area or street for
          the same type of houses in the North can vary greatly. Houses next
          door to each other may have a difference of around £20,000. The reason
          for this is the internal state of the house and degree of renovation.
          These houses are below the re-build cost - thus degree of renovation
          has a big effect on the property price. Also be aware that properties
          that are derelict or for auction sell for much higher than the guide
          prices which are shown as very low to attract bidders. They have often
          come to auction as they have not sold and often have major issues.
          They can be end up being much more costly than properties in the open
          market. Even if you get a property “free of charge” with structural
          issues that needs everything doing (electrics, central heating,
          windows, roof, damp-roofing, new kitchen, new bathroom, full
          decoration and carpets etc), it can end up costing you more than
          £69,999! The overall value offered by our package is unbeatable and we
          work very hard at every level to achieve savings, so we can offer
          everything to you for just £69,999 for a 2-bed house.
