        WE HELP PASSIVE INVESTORS BUY PROPERTIES IN THE UK
      </p>
      <p>
        We sell low cost houses to passive investors from the UK and all over
        the World. All of our properties are located in 28 towns in North East
        and North West England. After your purchase, we effectively become your
        long-term tenants and agree to pay you guaranteed rent and maintain the
        properties at our cost. You fully own the property, benefit from long
        term guaranteed rental income and future property capital growth, but do
        not need to do anything | we do it all. We treat the properties like our
        own and rent them out to our own tenants, becoming the landlord of the
        property and being liable for all tenant and property issues. We
        renovate properties well, and keep them in a good condition, with the
        aim of getting more rent from our tenants than we have to pay you. We do
        not sell houses for immediate own use (as these are already rented out
        at time of client purchase)
